### About this project 

I started this project to contribute to the dont starve together community (specially those who love developing things). 

**This is not a modding related thing**, The Don't starve together API only provides game information.


### IMPORTANT

- Don't starve together is developed by [Klei Entertainment](https://www.klei.com/). All the images and information of the game belongs to the developers.


- The project stills under development (i's not on internet for now).

### Don't know the game!?

[Here](https://www.klei.com/games/dont-starve-together) you can see more about the game and where to buy it. 


### Documentation ?

I really want to make a beautiful docs page with vue or svelte, but swagger looks pretty usefull and can be helpful for development now. I will be adding every development stuff like request collections and diagrams.
